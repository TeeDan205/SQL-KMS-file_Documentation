### ‚úçÔ∏è Dataset Description

- **Source**: The data was provided by the incubator hub for the purpose of the hackathon and final Examinations of my data analysis program by the organization. The dataset contains two .csv files information scraped from 2009 to 2012, including:
  
   - **KMS orders Table:** Contains 8,400 records of orders with 21 attributes including 
     - Order details: Order_ID, Order dates, price and quantities 
     - Customer information: Names, Province, segment and Region
     - Product details: category, sub-category, name, container, base margin, etc.
     - Financial metrics.
       
   - **Order_Status Table:** Contains 573 records of returned orders. Each record has an order_id and the status 'returned'. Orders not present in this table are considered not returned. 

 ### üß∞ Tools Used
 
   1. Microsoft Structured Query Language (SQL) Server Management Studio (For database management and query execution)
      
   2. GitHub Markdown for documentation in the repository.

### üßë‚Äçüî¨ Methodology 

In the initial phase of the data cleaning and preparation, the following actions were performed;
   - ‚è≥ **Data Acquisition and inspection:** The data was loaded and the total number of records and fields were confirmed to be the same from the source.
     
   - üîÉ **Data Import:** The two .csv data were imported by right-click on the database, then task and navigate to import flat file.
     
   - üßπ **Data Type formatting:** The data Type for each of the 21 attributes were ensured they are the correct data type. The order_id was changed to VarChar and made the primary key, order_date in DATE format, sales, shipping_cost, discount, unit_price and profit in decimal (10,2) data Type. The order_id consistency between datasets was also ensured.
     
   - üõ†Ô∏è **SQL schema and Setup:** A schema; a logical container that organizes database objects (tables, views, etc.) was setup. The default schema dbo (Database Owner) was used [dbo].[KMS] was used.


### üíπ SQL Analysis and Insights

The key business questions were answered by writing some structured query language

**Case scenario I:**
1. Which product category had the highest sales?
    **The Highest-Selling Category** was obtained by writing the below query:
     
   ![1qry REAL](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6494816d-fa85-4303-9248-3ebb71cd86ed)
   
   - The sales by product_category were sum up, ordered and the top one was picked.

   **Query Result:**

   ![1 ansa REAL](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8297778-060a-488f-baa4-f74c21dc4e01)

   **Key Insight:**
   Technology products generated 42% more revenue than second-place Furniture ($1.3M), indicating strong market demand for electronics.
   
2. What are the Top 3 and Bottom 3 regions in terms of sales?
     **The Top 3 Regions** were obtained by writing the query (ranked in descending order) as shown below:

    ![2qry](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ad326f9-bc17-47cd-bdde-e4b07b49e146)

    **Query Result:**

    ![2a Ansa](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8cfe621f-4dc0-4c48-aaa4-bbd9fb1c06da)

      **The Bottom 3 Regions** were obtained by writing the query (ranked in ascending order) as shown below:

    ![2b qry](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5739c21-c4c5-4f76-a971-926f4a0291c6)

    **Query Result:**
   
    ![2b ansa](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48c86a70-cfc9-4962-a969-0410c8ab5b21)

     **The Top/Bottom 3 Regions** in terms of sales are shown in the queries results shown above.
   
   - The sales was sum up by region, then ordered *appropriately* to select the top 3 and bottom 3.

     **Key Insight:** The Top (West) has sales of approximately **$3.6 million**, while the bottom region (Nunavut) has only **$116,376.47**. This indicates a massive gap of about 30 times between the highest and lowest performing regions. The top 3 regions (West, Ontario, Prarie) are the powerhouses of sales a **95% of total sales**, contributing significantly to the company's revenue. The total sales from the top 3 regions (**$9,498,066.61) are substantially higher than the bottom 3 regions (**$1,893,091.21) a **5% of total sales**, this indicates that the business is highly dependent on the top regions for revenue. In summary, the analysis reveals a stark contrast in sales performance across regions. The company should leverage the strong performance in top regions while developing targeted strategies to grow in the underperforming regions.
     
3. What were the total sales of appliances in Ontario? 

    **The Total Sales of Appliances in Ontario is found by writing the query below:**

    ![3 qry](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a13314ef-550e-4bcf-8e83-0343d1036d38)

    **Query Result:**

     ![3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/534926b6-15b3-406c-8348-bcf9db772d1b)

### üí° Strategic Recommendations and Conclusion

  1. The Top Regions should continue to nurture these markets with excellent service, product availability and targeted promotions to maintain and grow market share. Conduct market research to understand the unique challenges and opportunities of the bottom 3 regions.
  
  2. Leverage on Top Products. Since Technology products generated more revenue than other product category indicated strong market demand for electronics, consider deeper analysis on what drives their reviews to replicate success in other categories.
  
  3. Understand the reason for returning some orders and tackle it immediately.
  
  4. Optimize shipping cost by 15% to improve regional sales distribution.
  
  5. For high priority orders, use faster shipping mode (Express air) and for low priority orders, use cheaper shipping mode (Delivery truck)
